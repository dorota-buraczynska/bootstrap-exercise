#BOOTSTRAP PAGE

>MY FIRST WEB PAGE WITH BOOTSTRAP

This website was created using only bootstrap classes.  
For the first time I have used Sass here and compiled bootstrap styles from source, modifying some variables.

I found this exercise on [w3school website](https://www.w3schools.com/)
and recreated it without looking at source code.

##You can find here:
1. Fixed navbar
2. Jumbotron
3. Glyphicons
4. Bootstrap grids
5. Carousel
6. Form
7. Google maps
8. Panels
9. Spyscroll
10. Reveal effect
